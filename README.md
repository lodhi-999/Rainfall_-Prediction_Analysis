# **Rainfall Prediction Analysis Using Machine Learning**  

## **Project Description**  
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a structured approach to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building, this project demonstrates how machine learning models can analyze weather data to make accurate predictions.  

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of historical weather data, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological parameters. The target variable is binary, indicating whether it rained on a given day.  

---

## **Objective**  
The goal is to develop machine learning models that can predict rainfall by analyzing meteorological features, enhancing decision-making for weather forecasting and planning.

## **Steps Performed**  

### **1. Loading Dataset and Libraries**  
- Imported essential Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, 'imblearn' and `sklearn`.  
- Loaded the dataset and explored its structure using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()`.  

### **2. Data Cleaning**  
- Replaced missing values in the dataset with the **mean** of their respective columns to ensure no loss of information.  
- Standardized column names by removing whitespaces for consistency and easier referencing.  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Created a **correlation matrix** to identify highly correlated features that could negatively affect model performance by increasing dimensionality unnecessarily.  
- Plotted a **boxplot** to detect outliers but retained them due to the limited data size.  

### **4. Feature Engineering**  
- Separated the dataset into **features (independent variables)** and **target (dependent variable)** for further processing.  

### **5. Balancing and Standardizing Data**  
- Balanced the training dataset to address class imbalance issues, ensuring fair model training.  
- Standardized the features to bring all variables to a comparable scale, improving algorithm efficiency.  

### **6. Model Implementation**  
Used three machine learning models to predict rainfall:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **XGBClassifier**
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

## **Results**  
- Evaluated the performance of all models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Compared model performance to select the most accurate and efficient algorithm for rainfall prediction.
